# My-website


##This website is another form of my resume.

### For this webstie:
I’ve customized my website’s look and feel by using a consistent color scheme with a primary green (#4CAF50) and a dark gray (#333). The green is used for interactive elements like buttons and links, while the gray is mostly for text and headings, giving the site a clean, cohesive look.
For fonts, I chose Roboto because it has a modern and simple feel. I adjusted the line height to improve readability, and I made sure that the main headings are larger to create a clear hierarchy. Bold text is used for the navigation links and other important elements to make them stand out more.
The navigation bar has a dark background with white text, and when you hover over a link, the background changes to green with white text. I also added rounded corners to the links for a softer, more modern effect. Similarly, buttons are styled with the green color and rounded corners, and they have a hover effect that adds a slight dark overlay and shadow to make them pop.
I also made sure that all images are responsive, so they automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes. Each image has a shadow effect to give it a floating appearance, and the corners are rounded to match the overall style of the website.
The layout uses flexbox, which allows the text and images to be side by side on larger screens but stack vertically on smaller screens like mobile devices. This makes the website easy to navigate on any device. In the footer, I kept the design simple, matching the site’s background color and centering the text. The links in the footer also have a hover effect, where the text turns white when hovered over.
For responsiveness, I used media queries to ensure the site looks good on smaller screens. When viewed on mobile devices, the layout switches from horizontal to vertical, which makes it easier to read and interact with.
Lastly, I added a fade-in animation to the sections and images so that as you scroll or load the page, the content gradually appears. This gives the site a more polished and smooth look.**
